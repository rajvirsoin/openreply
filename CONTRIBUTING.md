# Contributing

Thanks for helping make InstaReply better.

This project is public because the core Instagram comment-to-DM engine should be inspectable, self-hostable, and useful to builders. The hosted SaaS will monetize managed infrastructure, agency workflows, analytics, reports, support, and templates.
